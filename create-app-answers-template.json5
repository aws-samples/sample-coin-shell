// This is a JSON 5 template that you can use as a reference when you want
// to run the Create App Wizard in headless mode by supplying a JSON file
// with values instead of answering the wizard's questions interactively.
// 
// To create a JSON file with wizard answers, create a new blank file
// with a ".json" extension and paste the contents of this file into it.
// Since JSON does not support comments, you will have to delete all
// comments from the ".json" file. Finally, fill in the values for each
// property. Once you've filled in values for all properties, you can run
// the Create App Wizard in headless mode by passing the location of
// your ".json" file as the first argument to the create-app.sh script.
// 
// Your ".json" file should NOT be committed to version control.
